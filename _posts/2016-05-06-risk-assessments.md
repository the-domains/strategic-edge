RISK ASSESSMENTS

Thorough and high quality assessments make the organization better equipped to enter and continuously operate in crisis environments.

Strategic Edge's analysis is grounded on expertise in: democracy restoration, developmental assistance, peace-building, deployments in conflict zones, post-conflict reconstruction. Guided by institutional expertise, driven by research and analysis tools.

Reliable information is a critical base for analysis. Best source: information "on the ground," directly and personally acquired, from people who are actually there.

We access information not always available on open sources through a transnational network active in critical sectors like:

* Civil Protection and Disaster Management
* Military and Security Forces
* Law Enforcement
* Justice and Human Rights
* Governance and Rule of Law, Human Security, Public Administration
* Political and Social Sciences
* Media and Public Relations.
