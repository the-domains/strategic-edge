# WOMEN'S SAFETY FIRST

In difficult parts of the world, support may not be readily available, especially in times of crises and insecurity.

It's important to build confidence, situational awareness, and verbal and physical resistance skills, and thereby reduce the likelihood of assault.

Our counter-violence and self-defense trainings are open to everyone, but with special focus on women's needs because:

* Women face risks unique to their gender, further escalated in a high-risk environment.
* Disasters reinforce, perpetuate, and increase gender inequality, making bad situations worse for women.
* Existing SOPs on risk reduction, security, and recovery are seldom gender- sensitive. Women must take the initiative to own the measures that will keep them safe.
* Women who can take care of themselves, as well as the teams under their leadership, are crucial contributors to risk reduction and resilience for all women.
